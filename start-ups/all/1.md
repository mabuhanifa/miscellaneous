## Hidden-gem picks (5–10 unconventional high-potential)

1. **API Marketplace for Local Integrations (Idea 78)** — many local providers have inconsistent docs; a clean wrapper product can become essential infra and attract devs + agencies.
2. **Address Standardization & Geocoding (Idea 86)** — delivery pain is huge in BD; solve addresses well and you own a crucial primitive.
3. **Microprojects Marketplace for Juniors (Idea 55)** — taps unpaid practice demand into paid, testable gigs; low cost to start and high social value.
4. **Digital Document Verification for Universities (Idea 33)** — once one university adopts it, others follow; high switching costs = sticky revenue.

6. **Localized Analytics for Bangla Sites (Idea 92)** — privacy-first alternatives to GA can win news publishers and niche blogs.
